## description

 A portfolio built using react. this deomonstrates my knoledge of react and using it to render different pages in an SPA or (single page application) its current form is unpolished and needs work. I'll devote more time to cleaning this up and making it look great in the weeks to come. but fo not it satisfies all of the development criteria and showcases my skills with useState useEffect and turnary operators.
